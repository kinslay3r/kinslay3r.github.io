    <p>Hello, my name is Keith Coffel, and I am currently working as a Student InformationSupport Specialist for my local school system, but am currently trying to 
      transition to a software engineering role. I completed my Bachelor of Information Sciences and Technology degree at <a href= "https://www.psu.edu/">Penn State University</a> in 2021.
    </p>
    <p>I got my start in programming by writing programs for the Commodore 64. Currently I am learning how to code in Python.</p>
