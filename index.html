<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img src="images/keith.jpg"></img>
<p>Hello, my name is Keith Coffel, and I am currently working as a Student InformationSupport Specialist for my local school system, but am currently trying 
  to transition to a software engineering role. I completed my Bachelor of Information Sciences and Technology degree at Penn State University in 2021.</p>

  <p>I got my start in programming by writing programs for the Commodore 64. Currently I am learning how to code in Python.</p>
